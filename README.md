This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to predict student academic performance, assess their digital readiness, identify "at-risk" students, and visualize overall student performance trends based on various academic and socio-economic factors. It utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for predictions and offers an interactive interface for insights.
